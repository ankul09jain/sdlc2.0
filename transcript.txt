## **Meeting Summary: Primetime Functional Walkthrough (April 21, 2025)**

### **Participants:**
- **Carlos** – Owner, Primetime  
- **Christina Strong** – Operations Director  
- **Vanesa Mendez** – Administrative Director  
- **Kuldeep Rajpurohit** – Technical Architect  
- **Nitin** – React Native Developer

---

### **1. Purpose of Meeting**
Vanesa initiated the meeting to demonstrate the three key user roles in the delivery platform:
- **Pharmacy/Partner login**
- **Driver login**
- **Admin login**

The walkthrough focused on core workflows and issues Primetime faces with its current system.

---

### **2. Partner Login (Pharmacy Access)**
- Each pharmacy has a unique login.
- Authentication includes a secure 2FA process.
- Partners can:
  - Upload delivery lists via spreadsheets.
  - Add deliveries individually.
  - View, print, and manage today's delivery list.
  - See delivery types: Regular, Express, Rush.
- Current pain point: Messaging consistency and delivery tracking accuracy.

---

### **3. Driver Experience**
- Driver app currently accessed via web.
- Drivers:
  - View their assigned deliveries (by zone).
  - See visual indicators (e.g., color codes for Express).
  - Mark deliveries with statuses like "Undeliverable" and add notes.
  - Currently **no route optimization**; drivers use the third-party app “**Road Warrior**” to manually optimize.

**Future Enhancements Requested:**
- Mobile app with built-in route optimization.
- Scanning capability (QR/barcode) to verify package delivery.
- OCR scanning for **proof of package delivery**.
- Automatic assignment based on scanned packages and zone.

---

### **4. Admin Portal Walkthrough**
- Accessible to only **Carlos, Christina, Vanesa**.
- Admins can:
  - Create and manage zones (via ZIP codes).
  - Assign packages manually or by zone.
  - Access delivery history across pharmacies.
  - Edit driver profiles and reassign zones.
- Current challenge: **Manual assignment** of each package is tedious.

---

### **5. Zones & Routing**
- Zones are defined by ZIP codes.
- Some ZIP codes may overlap across zones.
- Need for a **GIS-based mapping interface** to define and manage zones visually.
- Admins should be able to assign zones and filter by delivery types and pharmacy.

---

### **6. Mobile App Requirements**
Outlined by Gaurav and the team:
- Modular UX flow based on actual user (driver) behavior.
- Admins would benefit from configurable branding (logo-based color themes).
- Requirement to minimize clicks for major tasks.
- Suggestion to create wireframes, review journeys with client input, then proceed to hi-fi designs.

Vanesa mentioned she has personally performed many deliveries and can provide accurate feedback. Still, Gaurav requested a potential 30-min interview with a real driver to validate the pain points and UX.

---

### **7. PHP Upgrade Discussion**
- Christina requested a follow-up discussion on backend suggestions including PHP upgrades.
- Abhinav confirmed that **two options** for the PHP upgrade will be shared for review.
- Cost estimates and compliance impacts to be discussed in the next call.

---

### **8. HIPAA Compliance**
- Needs further discussion.
- Primetime acknowledged receipt of the compliance framework via email and agreed to revisit the topic on Thursday.

---

### **9. Key Requests by Client**
- Dispatcher login with **limited backend access**.
- Scanning-based automation to reduce manual admin dependency.
- Built-in route optimization (eliminating the need for Road Warrior).
- Improved messaging consistency and delivery update accuracy.
- Quick-print and search functionality for daily delivery sheets.
- Zone management via visual maps with drag-and-drop boundaries.

---

### **10. Next Steps**
- Team to share:
  - UX questions
  - PHP upgrade options and estimates
  - Design blueprint plan
- Next meeting confirmed for **Thursday, 9 AM EST**.
